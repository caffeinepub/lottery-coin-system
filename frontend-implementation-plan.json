Use the useAuth hook from AuthContext to check authentication state and the backend actor's isCallerAdmin method (or userProfile.role === 'admin') to verify admin status. Insert the link between the authenticated nav items and the coin balance display. Style the link with gold/amber accent color (text-amber-400 hover:text-amber-300) to match the existing theme. Ensure the link navigates to /admin/dashboard using the router Link component and is only visible when the user is authenticated and has admin role."
