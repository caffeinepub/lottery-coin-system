  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/src/components/Navbar.tsx to add an 'Admin Panel' link for admin users. The implementation checks isAdmin (isAuthenticated && userProfile?.role === 'admin'), renders an anchor tag navigating to /admin/dashboard, and styles it with amber/gold accent colors and hover effects, consistent with the gold-and-dark theme. All acceptance criteria for REQ-49 appear to be addressed.",
